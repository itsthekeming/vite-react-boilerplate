# Vite React (and others) Boilerplate

I made this project so that I didn't have to configure all of my favorite tools and utilities every time I wanted to spin up a project.

Included projects:

- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
- [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

Some helpful scripts:

- `dev`: run dev server
- `test`: run tests
- `typecheck`: run Typescript compiler
- `format`: format with Prettier
- `lint`: lint with ESLint
- `checkup`: run `typecheck`, `format`, and `lint` in succession
- `build`: build the project
- `serve`: preview the built project
