# Vite React (and others) Boilerplate

I made this project so that I didn't have to configure all of my favorite tools and utilities every time I wanted to spin up a project.

Included projects:
- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Dotenv
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky
- Commitizen

Some helpful scripts:
- dev: run dev server
- test: run tests
- typecheck: run Typescript compiler
- format: format with Prettier
- lint: lint with ESLint
- checkup: run typechecking, formatting, and linting
